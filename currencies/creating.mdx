### Overview
With this system, you can create and track multiple currencies within your Discord server. Whether you're managing in-game currencies, roleplay items, or just having fun with a custom economy, the possibilities are endless.

### What is a Ticker?
A ticker is a unique identifier for a currency, typically composed of a few letters, similar to stock symbols (e.g., GOLD for gold coins, SILV for silver coins). It's a shorthand way to refer to the currency within commands and displays.

### How to Create and Manage Currencies

To start creating and managing currencies, you will use two primary commands: `/curr create` and `/list`.

#### Creating a Currency

To create a new currency:
1. Use the command `/curr create`.
2. A modal will appear prompting you to input the currency ticker, which is a unique identifier like `GOLD`, `SILV`, etc.
3. Confirm the details to create the currency.

This command requires admin permissions and allows for the creation of numerous currencies, each uniquely identified by its ticker.

#### Listing All Currencies

To list all the currencies available in the server:
1. Use the command `/list`.
2. A list of all the currencies currently tracked in the server will be displayed.

This is a straightforward way to keep track of all active currencies and their details.
