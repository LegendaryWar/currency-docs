### Overview
Organizing currencies into groups helps keep your Discord server's economy system tidy and manageable. Currency groups allow you to categorize multiple currencies under different headings when using the `/balance` command.

### How to Create and Manage Currency Groups

To create and manage currency groups, you need to access the `/curr menu` for the specific currency ticker.

#### Accessing the Groups Menu
1. Use the command `/curr menu [ticker]`, where `[ticker]` is the unique identifier of the currency (e.g., GOLD, SILV).
2. In the menu that appears, locate the **Groups** button highlighted in the red rectangle in the image below:

#### Adding a New Group
1. Click on the **Groups** button to open the currency groups menu.
2. In the groups menu, click the **Add New Group** button.
3. Enter the name of the new group in the modal that appears, as shown in the image below:

#### Assigning Currencies to Groups
1. After creating a group, you can assign currencies to it. 
2. If you want to add a currency to a previously created group, there will be a dropdown menu where you can choose from the existing groups.

### Example of Grouped Currencies

When you use the `/balance` command, currencies will show up under their respective groups. Here is an example with two groups "Resources" and "Armies":
