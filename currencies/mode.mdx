### Overview
Managing the visibility and accessibility of currency balances is crucial for maintaining privacy and control within your Discord server. You can set the mode of your currency to be private, local, shared, or public, depending on your needs.

### How to Set Balance Visibility and Accessibility

To set the balance mode for a currency, you need to access the `/curr menu` for the specific currency ticker.

#### Accessing the Mode Menu
1. Use the command `/curr menu [ticker]`, where `[ticker]` is the unique identifier of the currency (e.g., GOLD, SILV).
2. In the menu that appears, locate the **Set Mode** button highlighted in the red rectangle in the image below:

2. Choose the desired balance mode from the dropdown menu, as shown in the image below:

### Balance Modes

- **Private:** Only the user can see their own balance. Staff are immune to this.
- **Local:** All members within the server can see and use the currency.
- **Shared:** The currency can be shared and used across multiple servers that have added it.
- **Public:** Any server can add and use the currency.
