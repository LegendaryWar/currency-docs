description: 'Assign staff roles to manage currencies with extra permissions'
---

### Overview
Staff roles in your Discord server are crucial for managing currencies effectively. People with a staff role have extra permissions, such as printing and unprinting currency, regardless of whether they are admins. Staff can also view balances of private currencies.

### Permissions and Responsibilities
- **Print/Unprint Currency:** Staff can add or remove currency from users.
- **View Private Balances:** Staff have access to the balances of private currencies, ensuring transparency and control.

### How to Set a Staff Role

To set a staff role, you need to access the `/curr menu` for the specific currency ticker.

#### Accessing the Staff Menu
1. Use the command `/curr menu [ticker]`, where `[ticker]` is the unique identifier of the currency (e.g., GOLD, SILV).
2. In the menu that appears, locate the **Staff** button highlighted in the red rectangle in the image below:

#### Selecting the Staff Role
1. Click on the **Staff** button to open the staff role selection menu.
2. Choose the role you want to assign as staff from the dropdown menu, as shown in the image below:

This will assign the selected role as the staff role, granting members with that role the necessary permissions to manage the currency.
