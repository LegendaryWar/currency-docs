### Overview
The bot allows you to sync currencies with other Discord servers, enabling seamless management and usage of the same currency across different communities. You can manage sync requests and view all synced servers easily.

### How to Sync Currency with Other Servers

To sync a currency with another server, you need to set the currency mode to either shared or public, and then follow the steps outlined below.

#### Steps to Sync Currency
1. **Set Mode to Shared or Public:**
   - Use the `/curr menu [ticker]` command.
   - Click on the **Set Mode** button and select either **Shared** or **Public** from the dropdown menu.

2. **Copy the UUID:**
   - In the currency management menu, locate the UUID for the currency. This UUID is needed to initiate the sync process.

3. **Sync on the Other Server:**
   - On the other server, use the command `/admin currency_sync [UUID]`, where `[UUID]` is the unique identifier for the currency.

4. **Accept Sync Request:**
   - If the mode was set to shared, go to the **Sync Requests** menu to accept the request from the other server. If the mode was set to public, the currency will be synced automatically.

#### Accessing Sync Menus
1. Use the command `/curr menu [ticker]`, where `[ticker]` is the unique identifier of the currency (e.g., GOLD, SILV).
2. In the menu that appears, locate the **Synced Servers** and **Sync Requests** buttons highlighted in the red rectangle in the image below:

#### Viewing and Disconnecting Synced Servers
- **Synced Servers:** 
  - Click on the **Synced Servers** button to view all servers that are currently synced with your currency.
  - You can disconnect a server by using its ID.
